# Hi there! 👋

## A Few Things About Me

I'm a **Platform Engineer at Okta**. Previously, I worked as a **DevOps Engineer for 3 years at Paytm**, where I was deeply immersed in:

- Designing and implementing fully automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Creating infrastructure using **Terraform** and leveraging **AWS** as a cloud platform.
- Reducing deployment time and increasing the frequency of impactful microservices deployments.

My current goal is to **learn MLOps and AiOps by the end of this year**. 🚀

I have a passion for **exploring new technologies** and **writing blogs** based on my learning experiences and research, which I publish on **[Medium](#)** and **[Substack](#)**.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not engineering solutions, you'll find me:

- **Reading novels and self-help books** (my current favorite: *The Power of Subconscious Mind* by Joseph Murphy).
- **Writing poems** that reflect my thoughts and emotions.
- **Nurturing my passion for gardening**, which keeps me grounded and offers a unique perspective on life and work.

Nature is a source of deep inspiration for me, fueling both my creativity and productivity. 🌱

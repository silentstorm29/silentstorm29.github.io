A few Things About Me 
-  I'm a Platform Engineer at Okta.
-  I was a Devops Engineer for 3 years at Paytm submerged in designing and implementing fully automated CI/CD pipelines,
  creating infrastructure using terraform utilizing AWS as a cloud platform reducing deployment time & increasing the
  frequency of impactful microservices deployments.
-  I plan to achieve my goal of learning MLOps and AiOps by the end of this year.
-  I enjoy exploring new technologies and writing blogs based on my
learning experiences & research (published on Medium & Substack).
-  Outside of work, I love reading novels and self-help books (my current favorite is "The Power of Subconscious Mind" by
Joseph Murphy), writing poems, and nurturing my passion for gardening, all helping in my
sustained lifestyle. Nature inspires deep thinking and offers a unique perspective on tasks for
me.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any DevOps/SRE/Platform related Automation

# Hi there! 👋

![My Picture](assets/myphoto.JPG)

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.

## A Few Things About Me

I'm a **Platform Engineer at Okta**, passionate about designing, implementing, and maintaining robust infrastructure. Before this, I worked as a **DevOps Engineer for 3 years at Paytm**, where I:

- Designed and implemented fully automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Built and managed infrastructure using **Terraform**, leveraging **AWS** as the cloud platform.
- Reduced deployment times and increased the frequency of impactful microservices deployments.

My current goal is to **learn MLOps and AiOps by the end of this year**. 🚀

I also enjoy **writing blogs** based on my learning experiences and research, which I publish on **[Medium](#)** and **[Substack](#)**.

## Outside of Work

When I’m not immersed in engineering solutions, you can find me:

- **Reading novels and self-help books** (*current favorite: The Power of Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy*).
- **Writing poems** to express my thoughts and emotions.
- **Gardening**, which inspires creativity and helps me stay grounded.

Nature offers me deep inspiration, fueling my productivity and helping me approach challenges with a fresh perspective. 🌱
